Hi! My name is Cristina Rodriguez, and I am a software engineer. I received training from Hackbright Academy, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco (graduation: March 2017). I was a recipient of the 2018 Grow Scholarship from Google and Udacity for Android Basics, and I have five apps in the Google Store. Now I'm studying the basics of react-native to be able to publish my apps in IOs too. I'm currently seeking a front-end developer role in the Greater Seattle Area. If you have a position that I should hear about, feel free to email yosola at Gmail.
